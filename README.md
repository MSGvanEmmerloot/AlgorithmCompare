# algorithmCompare

## Synopsis

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the performance differences between certain algorithms.
Currently, it features algorithms that can be used to sort the contents of an array.

## Code Example

To initialize the ArrayCompare class, execute the ArrayCompare.Init() function. 
Inside this function, the algorithms are selected that have to be tested. Algorithms can easily be added or removed from the List.
Currently, the comparison functionality is executed by executing the ArrayCompare.RunTestBench() function.
This function will execute all algorithms for all provided arrays and measure the elapsed time for every combination.

## Motivation

In order to visualize the efficiency of multiple sorting algorithms, I decided to make this program.
First and foremost, this project exists because it seemed interesting to me to create it.
